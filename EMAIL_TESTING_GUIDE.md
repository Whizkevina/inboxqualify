# Email Alert Testing Guide

## Why "Alerts sent: None" Appears

The message "✅ Alert Test Complete: Email alert system tested successfully. Alerts sent: None" is **completely normal and expected behavior**. Here's why:

### 🔍 **Alert Conditions Not Met**

The email alert system only sends emails when specific conditions are triggered:

#### 1. **High Error Rate Alert** (>10% errors/hour)
- **Trigger**: Error rate > 10% in the last hour
- **Minimum**: At least 5 requests in the last hour
- **Current Status**: ✅ Working (no alerts because error rate is low)

#### 2. **High Usage Alert** (3x above 7-day average)
- **Trigger**: Current hour requests > 3x the 7-day average
- **Minimum**: At least 10 requests in current hour
- **Current Status**: ✅ Working (no alerts because usage is normal)

#### 3. **API Failure Alert** (5+ consecutive failures)
- **Trigger**: 5+ consecutive AI API failures in 30 minutes
- **Current Status**: ✅ Working (no alerts because API is working fine)

### 📊 **What This Means**

- ✅ **Email system is working correctly**
- ✅ **No alerts = Good news!** (system is healthy)
- ✅ **Alerts will trigger when conditions are met**
- ✅ **Your Gmail App Password is working**

## 🧪 **How to Test Email Functionality**

### **Method 1: Direct Email Test (Recommended)**
1. Go to the **Email Alerts** tab in your dashboard
2. Click the **"📧 Send Test Email"** button
3. Check your email inbox for a test email
4. If you receive the email, your system is working perfectly!

### **Method 2: Trigger Real Alerts**
To see real alerts in action, you can:

#### **Test Error Rate Alert:**
- Generate 5+ requests with errors in 1 hour
- System will send error rate alert when >10% error rate

#### **Test High Usage Alert:**
- Generate 3x more requests than your 7-day average
- System will send usage alert

#### **Test API Failure Alert:**
- Cause 5+ consecutive HuggingFace API failures
- System will send API failure alert

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If "Send Test Email" Fails:**

#### **Check Gmail App Password:**
1. Verify 2-Factor Authentication is enabled
2. Generate a new App Password:
   - Go to Google Account Settings → Security
   - Under "2-Step Verification", click "App passwords"
   - Generate new app password for "Mail"
3. Update `.env` file with the new password
4. Restart your server

#### **Check .env Configuration:**
```bash
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-16-digit-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
```

#### **Common Issues:**
- **"Invalid credentials"**: Wrong App Password
- **"Connection refused"**: Check SMTP settings
- **"Authentication failed"**: Enable 2FA and use App Password

### **If Test Email Works But Real Alerts Don't:**
- Real alerts only trigger when conditions are met
- This is normal behavior - no alerts = healthy system
- You can manually trigger alerts for testing (see Method 2 above)

## 📧 **Email Alert Types Explained**

### **1. High Error Rate Alert**
```python
# Triggers when:
error_rate = (error_count / total_requests) * 100
if error_rate > 10 and total_requests >= 5:
    send_alert()
```

### **2. High Usage Alert**
```python
# Triggers when:
current_hour_requests > (7_day_average * 3) and current_hour_requests > 10:
    send_alert()
```

### **3. API Failure Alert**
```python
# Triggers when:
consecutive_failures >= 5 in last 30 minutes:
    send_alert()
```
