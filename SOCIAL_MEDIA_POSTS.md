🧵 The Science Behind Effective Cold Emails (Based on 1000+ Analyses)

After analyzing thousands of cold emails through InboxQualify, here are the patterns that separate successful outreach from spam:

📊 OPTIMAL METRICS:
• Subject Line: 30-50 characters
• Email Body: 50-200 words
• Personalization: Specific, not generic
• Value Prop: Clear and measurable

🎯 WHAT HIGH-SCORING EMAILS HAVE:
→ Specific research about the recipient
→ Clear, quantifiable benefits
→ Single, focused call-to-action
→ Professional yet conversational tone

❌ WHAT KILLS RESPONSE RATES:
→ Generic "Dear Sir/Madam" openings
→ Vague value propositions
→ Multiple CTAs creating confusion
→ Overly salesy language

InboxQualify's AI identifies these patterns and guides you toward the winning formula.
