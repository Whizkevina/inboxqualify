## 🔧 Why You're Not Getting Emails

### Root Cause: Gmail App Password Required
Your email configuration is missing the **Gmail App Password**. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account Settings → Security
   - Under "2-Step Verification", click "App passwords"
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
3. **Update your .env file**:
   ```
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your-16-digit-app-password
   ```
4. **Restart your server** after updating the .env file

### Current Configuration Status
- ✅ SMTP_SERVER: smtp.gmail.com
- ✅ SMTP_USERNAME: timmyondbeat@gmail.com
- ❌ SMTP_PASSWORD: Not set (needs Gmail App Password)
- ✅ ADMIN_EMAIL: timmyondbeat@gmail.com
